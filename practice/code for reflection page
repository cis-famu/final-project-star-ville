            Throughout the semester, I have learned to create an HTML and fully utilize the features on my iPad. 
            Students started this course by learning how to storyboard a website by creating a wireframe. </p>
            
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;" class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
            During our HTML portion of the course, I learned how to create basic HTML and use CSS and JavaScript.
            We also learned how to make a responsive website using different frameworks. 
            I was initially assigned Materialize and decided to use Materialize to create the website you are currently using. 
            The more I continued to use Materialize, the easier it got. 
            I started thinking of things as a grid, which helped with planning and coding the website. </p>
            
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;" class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
            We then started different modules that focused on applications on the iPad. 
            The apps used were Garage Band, Sketches, and Clips. On Garage Band, we created our own 40-second songs.
            On sketches, we created different drawings utilizing various techniques, such as tracing and shading. 
            We created a video introducing ourselves on Clips. 
            I would say that Garage Band and Sketches were my favorite apps that we used this semester. 
            I can see myself going back to continue using those apps. 
            I wanted to get into writing songs in the future, so learning how to use Garage Band was extremely helpful.  </p>
            
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;" class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
            Our first major project for this class was grouping up and creating a podcast. 
            This podcast would utilize the applications I mentioned earlier. 
            For our podcast, we would create a logo and theme song. 
            Each group recorded and posted 5 episodes. 
            My group decided to make a music podcast called Rythmn Rundown.
            </p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;" class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
            I really enjoyed this class and the skills that it taught me. 
            I started this class not knowing what HTML exactly was ( or that an HTML file needed to end with .html, or it wouldn’t run). 
            I can now make a functioning website! ☺️ 
            Through this class, I got to work with Garage Band and make a podcast, two things I was really excited about. 
            I’m now over the hurdle of being completely lost. 
            I plan to continue using and building on the skills I’ve learned in this class for school and other fun activities.
