            <p class="left-align"><b>Snap Judgement</b> by Snap Judgement and PRX is a podcast that invites guests to retell stories in which they had to make snap judgments. 
            These stories can range from stealing a chocolate bar as a kid to trying to survive. 
            Each episode starts with the host telling a story from his own life to introduce the story the storyteller will tell. 
            Throughout the podcast episode, music is used to build on the emotions of the storyteller, mainly to build suspense. 
            The storytellers speak as if they are in an interview, making it feel as if we, the audience, are asking them the questions. </p>

            Since then, I've had <i>CLOSE YOUR EYES, GROWING/DYING, SLOWING DOWN, and KNOW YOUR NAME</i> (all of which are featured on <u><i>WAITING TO SPILL</i></u>) on repeat.
